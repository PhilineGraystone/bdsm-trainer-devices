# BDSM Trainer - Devices

Here you can find some devices that work with the BDSM Trainer.

the BDSM Trainer (the control unit) supports the protocols IP/HTTP, IP/HTTPS and the 433 Mhz radio network.

The devices are realized with the following devices:

* Arduino 
* ESP32
* ESP8266

As soon as enough devices have been developed, there will also be an app for mobile devices and the like.

# What can you find in this repository?
Circuit diagrams and stripboard diagrams for all devices, and a list of the required components. Of course there is also the source, so that you can use the devices,

With pleasure I take up new devices and try to realize your ideas.
